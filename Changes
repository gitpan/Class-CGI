Revision history for Class-CGI

0.04   2006-04-11
       - Do not load Config::Std unless needed.
       - handlers() method without arguments now returns the currently used
         handlers.
       - Tremendously improved test coverage.  Devel::Cover lists one branch
         as untested (and I can't figure out why).
       - Minor documentation clarifications.
       - Updated the manifest to include the tests :/

0.03   2006-04-08
       - Now passes the parameter name is the second argument to the handler
         constructor.  Thanks to Aristotle for pointing out how useful that
         would be.
       - Handlers can now be defined in a config file rather than being
         continuously redefined in the code.

0.02   2006-04-07
       - Added 'raw_param' method which allows the user to fetch the actual
         value of a parameter and ignore handlers defined for it.
       - Handlers now accept the Class::CGI object instead of the value of the
         corresponding parameter.  This makes them far more flexible (when
         will I learn that I should default to passing objects instead of
         scalars?)

0.01   2006-04-07 
       - First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
